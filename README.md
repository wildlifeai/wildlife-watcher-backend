# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## üê≥ Development with Docker

The easiest way to get started is using Docker and Docker Compose. This will set up both Strapi and PostgreSQL in containers.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Docker Compose plugin installed on your machine

### Starting the application

1. Copy the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. View the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

4. Access the application:

- Strapi Admin: http://localhost:1337/admin
- API: http://localhost:1337/api

### Useful Docker commands

```bash
# Stop the containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild the containers
docker compose up -d --build

# View container status
docker compose ps

# Access the Strapi container
docker exec -it strapi /bin/sh

# Access the PostgreSQL container
docker exec -it strapiDB /bin/sh
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development (without Docker)

### `develop`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled.

```bash
npm run develop
```

### `start`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled.

```bash
npm run start
```

### `build`

Build your admin panel.

```bash
npm run build
```

## üêã Docker Deployment

This project uses GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) to host private Docker images. The images are built automatically on push to main branch.

### Container Registry

Private images are stored at: `ghcr.io/wildlifeai/wildlife-watcher-backend`

Available tags:

- `main` - latest build from main branch

### Running in Production

Migrations need to be documented (not sure how Strapi currently handles it). You need to ssh to the azure container, and update the image:

```bash
cd /opt/wildlife-watcher-backend/
```

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Creating a New Release

To create a new versioned release:

Push to the main branch and the GitHub actions will take over.
